# MultiAuthenticator for JupyterHub

This package allows you to use multiple authenticators in JupyterHub at the same time.  For example, you can allow logins via LTI, and alternatively logins via OAuth and local accounts.

## Installation

Install the package via pip into the hub.  If you are using TLJH, you can do:

    /opt/tljh/hub/bin/pip install -e .
